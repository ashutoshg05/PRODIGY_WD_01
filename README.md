# PRODIGY_WD_01

This project creates a responsive and interactive navigation menu that remains fixed at the top of the page and adjusts its styling when a user scrolls or hovers over menu items. The menu improves user experience by providing clear visual feedback as users navigate the site.
The project enhances website navigation by making it more intuitive and user-friendly. A fixed navigation bar ensures easy access to all sections of the site, and the style changes on scroll and hover provide users with clear visual cues, making it easier to identify their current location or available options.
To get started, users can download the project files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and include them in their website. The code is straightforward and customizable, allowing users to easily adapt the navigation menu to fit their design preferences or website structure.
Users can reach out through GitHub.
The project is maintained by you, with potential contributions from other developers. As the project grows, others can contribute by improving the design, functionality, or documentation.
